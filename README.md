## README Description for GitHub Repository: **Airly Vision Forecast**

### Overview

**Airly Vision Forecast** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to analyze and forecast air quality using advanced data-driven techniques. Built on robust machine learning models and interactive visualization tools, this project empowers users with actionable insights into air pollution dynamics. The web application leverages pollutant and meteorological datasets to provide real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and visualization of air quality trends across urban environments.

### Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, CO, Ozone) from multiple monitoring stations.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Short-term forecasting of air quality using machine learning models like Random Forests and BiGRU-GCN hybrid architectures.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore time-series visualizations, pollution hotspot maps, and meteorological overlays for enhanced decision-making.
- **Health Risk Calculator**: Assess exposure impacts based on pollutant concentrations and WHO guidelines.
- **Advanced Visualization Tools**: Correlation heatmaps, animated trends, and seasonal variations for deeper data insights.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive timely updates on critical pollution levels to foster awareness and mitigation strategies.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Pollutant datasets sourced from CPCB monitoring stations integrated with meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.
2. **Preprocessing**: Missing values handled using KNN imputation; feature engineering includes time-based variables like hour, day, season.
3. **Model Development**: Machine learning models trained on historical data for accurate AQI predictions; PCA used for feature selection.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive tools developed for real-time data interpretation and mapping.

### Future Directions

- Integration of high-resolution boundary layer dynamics for improved model precision.
- Expansion to ultrafine particle measurements and advanced health impact assessments.

### Deployment
